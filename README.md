### Quick Overview

This is a take home coding project for the Junior Software Engineering position @ _Company_.
I chose to create this in Flutter since I was told in the interview if it could be used for work projects then I'd be baptized in it.

The project task is to create a mobile application that has the functionality of a profile page, following the UI guide [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/58778ee1-0bc4-40d9-55fb-cea5b22ab1c8-2e46/)

### Running the project

This targets both iOS and Android devices. To run this you need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Follow the getting started guide for your operating system, which includes sections on iOS and Android setup.

- For iOS, open simulator with `open -a simulator` then from the command line run `flutter run`.
- For Android, open the emulator through Android Studio then from the command line run `flutter run`.

**Using Images:** To use your own images for profile pictures, simply drag and drop them into iOS simulator/Android emulator. They should be available in Photos/downloads respectively.
